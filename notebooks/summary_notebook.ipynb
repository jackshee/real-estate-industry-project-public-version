    "# Methodology and Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Structure and Preparation\n",
    "- **Panel Data**: 41,346 observations across 849 suburb and property type combinations and 43 time periods\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: Median rental price by suburb, property type, and time period\n",
    "- **Temporal Range**: 2013 Q2 to 2025 Q1 (training: 2013-2023, testing: 2024-2025)\n",
    "\n",
