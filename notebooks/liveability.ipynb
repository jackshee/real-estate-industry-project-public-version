    "How to Read It\n",
    "The weights follow your earlier intuition: work, affordability, and health matter most (0.12–0.18 each); education, safety, and food/nightlife are mid-tier (0.10–0.12); transport and services keep convenience in view (0.08); detractors get a negative weight to reduce the final index when undesirable features dominate. Because every subscore is normalized, (L) lives on roughly ([-0.10, 1.0]), making comparisons straightforward.\n",

    "Re-check weight choices with team/user research or sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "Confirm each subscore’s normalization window (city-wide vs. suburb-only).\n",
    "Add columns to notebooks/liveability.ipynb calculating these pillars and the final (L); visualize quartiles or top suburbs once ready."
